- 👋 Hi, I’m Sun
- 👀 I’m interested in Technology, Gaming (primarily Minecraft) and YouTube
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Project_Actronix in the future, but for now, nothing :-)
- 📫 How to reach me sunplaysminecraft@protonmail.com (bussiness or technology email)

<!---
ItsSun/Project_Actronix is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its a fork of OpenShot Video Editor and I want it to have similar look to Windows Movie Maker,
but with more modern and old but useful features,
I want it to be a complete video production and video creation package,
something like blender, but targeted towards YouTubers.
