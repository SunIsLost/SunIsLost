ItsSun/Project_Actronix is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its a fork of OpenShot Video Editor and I want it to have similar look to Windows Movie Maker,
but with more modern and old but useful features,
I want it to be a complete video production and video creation package,
something like blender, but targeted towards YouTubers.
